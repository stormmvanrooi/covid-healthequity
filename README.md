Project Description
The COVIDâ€‘19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread, severity, and have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national public health agencies. 

For this project, we will be looking at the rate of vaccination based on age and socioeconomic status. Based on this data analysis, 
we will develop insights into the barriers to vaccination among these demographics, as well as reasons why the vaccine rate increases and decreases seasonally or based on events. 

We will also do an analysis on the rate of vaccinations compared to hospitalizations and comparing the rate of death. 
 
Research Questions
 Who is getting the vaccine? What age, race/ethnicity, gender?
 Based on race/ethnicity groups, are there triggers to an increased number of vaccinations?
 Based on socioeconomic status, who is getting vaccinated? What could be a barrier to vaccination?
 Rate of vaccination compared to hospitalizations and comparing the rate of death to those in hospitals.
